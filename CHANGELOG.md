# Changelog

All notable changes to the clock generator (`clock-generator` and `clock-generator-ui`) will be documented in this file.
The Factorio mods keep their own `changelog.txt`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
`clock-generator/package.json` and `clock-generator-ui/package.json` share the same version.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Clock alternatives: each run produces several clocks (planned, derived windows, belt pickup slack, lower output swing counts, fractional periods), and the UI lists each with its rate and stability. ([#67](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/67))
- As-built check: re-simulates a build driven only by the exported clock windows, from several clock start points. ([#67](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/67))
- Verify CLI: `npm run verify -- --config=... --recording=...` compares a `clock-generator-recorder` recording with the simulation. ([#67](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/67))
- Subtick clock alternatives that run fractional periods at the exact target rate. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- Full-hand output alternative, offered when output inserters need extra grabs per hand. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- Modulo clock blueprints: blueprints are exported as a book with a modulo clock version and a raw timings version, with every combinator pre-wired. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- Flow based configuration view (beta). ([#60](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/60))
- Transfer plan shown in the UI, with the option to exclude ingredients from the LCM. ([#58](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/58))
- Drag and drop entity reordering. ([#56](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/56))

### Changed
- Clock alternatives are generated in parallel Web Workers and shown as soon as each one finishes. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- Faster simulation, and debug output is off unless enabled. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- The state transition timeline is drawn on a canvas, fixing out of memory errors in the browser on long periods. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- The clock decider combinator faces south, and virtual signals in descriptions use `[virtual-signal=...]` rich text. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- Long clock periods shorten the warmup instead of failing. ([#69](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/69))

### Fixed
- The simulator matches the game more closely: ingredients are consumed when a craft starts, machines update after inserters, a machine is output-full when its next craft won't fit, and inserters are processed downstream first. ([#67](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/67))
- Decider window bounds are rounded to whole ticks. ([#68](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/68))
- Machines fed through several inserter paths are now planned to supply all of them. ([#69](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/69))
- Input inserter deadlock for multi-ingredient belt to machine inputs with a reduced `terminal_swing_count`. ([#61](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/61))
- Exported configurations no longer include internal UI ids. ([#59](https://github.com/abucnasty/factorio-scripts/pull/59))
